== Configuring Java builds with disabled dependencies rebuild

You must configure your repository by creating a ConfigMap called `jvm-build-config` to ensure that your namespace or workspace uses the JVM build service. When this ConfigMap is present, the build service operator configures the necessary in a workspace. To speed up the build process and reduce the load on Maven Central, this ConfigMap currently creates an artifact cache that caches Maven objects.

When building an application, the system redirects all requests by using this artifact cache. By default this proxies to maven central, however, you can configure other repositories.

.*Procedure*

. Browse to an appropriate repository and create a file, for example, `config.yaml`.

. In the `config.yaml` file, create a *ConfigMap* resource with the following data:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: jvm-build-config
namespace: test-jvm-namespace
Data:
maven-repository-300-jboss: "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/" <1>
maven-repository-301-jitpack: "https://jitpack.io"
maven-repository-302-confluent: "https://packages.confluent.io/maven"
maven-repository-303-gradle: "https://repo.gradle.org/artifactory/libs-releases"
maven-repository-304-eclipselink: "https://download.eclipse.org/rt/eclipselink/maven.repo"
maven-repository-305-redhat: "https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga"
maven-repository-306-gradleplugins: "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2"
maven-repository-307-jsweet: "https://repository.jsweet.org/artifactory/libs-release-local‚Äù
----
<1> To add a maven repository the key in the map must follow a set pattern, which is, maven-repository-$priority-$name: $repo-url. Additionally, Maven central has a priority of 200; therefore the system tries anything with a lower priority before maven central. The rebuilt artifacts have a priority of 100.
