xref:concepts/RenovateBot/index.adoc[RenovateBot] has many link:https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options[configuration options]. This guide gives an example of how to configure your RenovateBot with the `reviewers` configuration option. The `reviewers` option automatically adds a user or user group to the reviewer field when RenovateBot creates a pull request.

.*Prerequisites*

* You have Tekton support enabled in RenovateBot.


.*Procedures*

. Navigate to the `renovate.json` file in the repo that references your Tekton bundles.
. Open the `renovate.json` file by using any IDE that is compatible with `.json` files.
. Underneath the `tekton` property, enter the following text:

+

`{ “reviewers”: [ “<username>” OR “<Email address>” ] }`

+
.. You can assign a GitHub team as the reviewer by adding the following:

+

`{ “reviewers”: [ “team:<teamname>” ] }`

+

. Save the file. Your configuration is now updated.
