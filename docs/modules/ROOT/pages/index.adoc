= About Enterprise Contract

Enterprise Contract is a set of tools and policies that maintains the security
of the software supply chain. Tools such as
https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/[Tekton Chains] can produce a signed
https://in-toto.io/in-toto/[in-toto] attestation of the software build process,
a set of xref:ec-policies:ROOT:index.adoc[policies] attests that the process
followed a perscribed set of best practices and organization's requirements that
can be evaluated using the xref:ec-cli:ROOT:index.adoc[tools] to maintain the
supply chain security.

There's an additional overview of Enterprise Contract and its components in the
