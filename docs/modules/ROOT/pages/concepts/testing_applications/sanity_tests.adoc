== Scope
This document covers the sanity tests contained in {ProductName} that are executed as part of the {ProductName} component build pipeline. The sanity tests for {ProductName} automatically test all application images to ensure they are up to date, correctly formatted, and protect them from security vulnerabilities.

== Sanity Tests
The {ProductName} component build pipeline supports several types of tests, including sanity tests. The sanity tests used in {ProductName} are executed in the form of https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#overview[Tekton tasks]. The utility used for validating container information is https://www.conftest.dev/[conftest]. Currently implemented sanity tests are listed below. Only sanity tests which are currently implemented are listed in this section.
