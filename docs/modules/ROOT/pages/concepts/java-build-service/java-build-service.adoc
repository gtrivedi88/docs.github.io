= Java build service

== JVM Build Service
The JVM Build Service enhances your Java builds, by providing the following features:

* A local cache of Maven artifacts to speed up build times

* Provides SBOM generation based on artifact tracking to find dependencies in your final image

* Allowing you to rebuild Java dependencies from the source so that you can be sure of your dependencies' provenance

You can configure standard Java builds:

* When you have xref:cli/proc_enabled_java_dependencies.adoc[enabled dependencies rebuild].

* When you have xref:cli/proc_disabled_java_dependencies.adoc[disabled dependencies rebuild].
