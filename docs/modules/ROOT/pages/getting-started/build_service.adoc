= Build Pipeline customization

You can update and manage the Build Pipelines for each component in your application.

NOTE: {ProductName} leverages the xref:concepts/pipelines/index.adoc[pipeline services] to build images.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a Git repository that follows xref:concepts/pipelines/index.adoc#_pipeline_as_code[Pipelines as Code].

* The Git repository has a build _PipelineRun_ template in the `.tekton` directory.

* The build <<_pipelinerun_template>> follows the annotations used by Pipelines as Code.


== Customizing the Build Pipeline

.Procedure

* Update the `.yml` files in your `\{source_repository} > .tekton` directory for appropriate _PipelineRun_ definitions. The `.tekton` directory can have many .yml files, for example, `push.yml` or `pull.yml`. The following example displays a _PipelineRun_ to run the `build-service-on-push` pipeline:
+
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1 <1>
kind: PipelineRun <2>
metadata:
    name: build-service-on-push <3>
    Annotations: <4>
        pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-event: "[push]"
        pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-target-branch: "[main]"
spec:
    Params: <5>
        - name: git-url
          value: "{{repo_url}}"
        - name: revision
          value: "{{revision}}"
        - name: output-image
          value: 'quay.io/redhat-appstudio/build-service:{{revision}}'
        - name: infra-deployment-update-script
          value: "quay.io/redhat-appstudio/pull-request-builds:has-{{revision}}"
    pipelineRef:
          name: docker-build <6>
          bundle: quay.io/redhat-appstudio/{ProductName}-core-service-templates-bundle:latest
Workspaces: <7>
        - name: workspace
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: app-studio-default-workspace
          subPath: build-service-push-{{ revision }}
----

<1> PipelineRun API version v1beta1.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, _PipelineRun_.
<3> Unique name to identify this PipelineRun.
<4> Pipelines as Code adds Annotations automatically when it creates the PipelineRun object on OpenShift.
<5> Specifies the list of parameters required to run the Pipeline.
<6> Name of the Pipeline that the system runs. In this example, build-and-deploy.
<7> Workspace used by the PipelineRun.

== _PipelineRun_ template

To create a build PR, the `{_PipelineRun_ template}.yml` file in the `\{source_repository} > .tekton` directory must include:

* params
* workspace
* annotation
* pipelineRef

=== params

Every supported Tekton Pipeline resource should populate any of the following user-defined params as part of their build execution in a _PipelineRun_:

* git-url

* git-revision

* output-image

* dockerfile-path

* path-context

=== Annotations

Annotations are additional, informative tags. A tag allows you to classify or group various objects to ensure that you can easily watch them after an execution. The values of annotations do not change during runtime because they are static.

NOTE: Pipelines as Code adds Annotations automatically when it creates the PipelineRun object on OpenShift.

=== Workspaces


=== Supported build types

You must include any of the following `pipelineRef` as part of their build execution in a _PipelineRun_:

*docker-build*:: Builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a "context‚Äù
*devfile-build*: Extracts the build from the contents of the outerloop spec in devfiles
*java-builder (maven via pom.xml)*:: Provides a default container suitable for java applications
*nodejs-builder*:: Provides a default container suitable for node.js applications.
